### Awesome MacOS Software v2.0.2 ([Marvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android))

<img width="100" height="100" alt="icon_macos_02" src="assets/icon_macos_02.png">

A curated list of fantastically awesome software for Apple's macOS operating system. This list was inspired by
[Awesome Sysadmin](https://github.com/kahun/awesome-sysadmin). Legend: Open Source apps = ![Open Source][oss]. Paid
apps = ![Dollar][mon]. Free apps have a ![Free][free] icon. Any app with a yellow star (![Star][fav]) is one of my 
favorites and something that I recommend you check out. Note: I wanted to have a little fun with the version numbers, 
so starting with v1.9.4, all versions will be named after sci-fi robots, androids, cyborgs, supercomputers, etc.
